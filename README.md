# Advanced_NLP_Project
In this project, we try to predict movie genres based on their description using the following Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb

Please note the following important contents of the repo:
* <tt>`final-advanced.ipynb`</tt> is the notebook that walks through the analysis.
* <tt>`helper_functions.py`</tt> includes some of the custom functions we wrote that were left out of the the notebook
